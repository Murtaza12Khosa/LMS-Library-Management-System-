Search for books by title, author, ISBN, or category

**Admin Dashboard**

View all issued books (currently issued and returned)

View fine records for students

Generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports:

    Books issued

    Books returned

**Technologies Used**
Python 3.x

Flask Web Framework

JSON for API communication

**Installation**
**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x installed

MySQL server installed and running

**Steps**
1. Clone the repository:


        git clone https://github.com/Murtaza12Khosa/library-management-system.git
        cd library-management-system
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
        venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
3. Install required dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set up your MySQL database:

Create a database named lmsystem

Import your SQL schema or manually create tables:

    User, Book, Category, IssuedBooks, etc.

5. Configure database connection in app.py (or your config file):


        app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
        app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'root'
        app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = ''
        app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'lmsystem'

6. Run the Flask app:

       flask run

Or if you use your main file directly:

    python app.py

7. Access API endpoints at http://localhost:5000/api/...
